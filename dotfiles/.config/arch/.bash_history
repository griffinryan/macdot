[200~In particular, the content of the $PATH environment variable, once directly logged under fish, should be checked and adjusted to one's need. In fish, $PATH is defined as a global environment variable: it has a global scope across all functions, it is lost upon reboot and it is an environment variable which means it is exported to child processes. The recommended way of adding additional locations to the path is by calling the fish_add_path command from config.fish. For example:

$ fish_add_path -p /first/path /second/path /third/one
These three locations will be prepended to the path.

Setting fish as interactive shell only
chsh -s $(which fish)
